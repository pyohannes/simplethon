Simplethon
==========

Simplethon is the name of a programming language that comprises a subset of
the Python programming language. This project contains *sth*, a compiler that
compiles Simplethon code to C code.

Simpleton code can both be interpreted by a Python interpreter and compiled by
*sth*, whereas *sth* strives for full compatibility of the language subset.
